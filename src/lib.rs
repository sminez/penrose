//! # Penrose: a library for building your very own tiling window manager
//!
//! Penrose is inspired by similar projects such as [dwm][1], [xmonad][2] and [qtile][3] which
//! allow you to configure your window manager in code and compile it for your system. It is most
//! similar to `xmonad` in that it is more of a library for building a window manager (with low
//! level details taken care of for you) rather than a minimal window manager that you edit and
//! patch directly (such as `dwm`). Penrose strives to be as simple as possible in its
//! implementation in order to make the guts of the window manager easier to understand. Given the
//! nature of what this involves, this is not always possible but effort has been made to keep the
//! source readable and with relatively free of magic.
//!
//!
//! ## Using Penrose
//!
//! Penrose itself is not a binary application that you can build, install and run. You need to
//! write your own **main.rs** as a rust binary crate that uses Penrose as a dependency to set up,
//! configure and run your very own window manager exactly how you want it. In short, you *will*
//! need to write some code and you *will* need to know Rust to some degree.
//!
//! For learning rust itself, there are some fantastic official [guides][4] available on
//! rust-lang.org and if you are sticking to using the out of the box functionality provided
//! by the penrose crate, working through [The Rust Book][5] before diving into penrose should be more
//! than enough to get you started.
//!
//! On GitHub you can find up to date [examples][6] of how to set up and configure a window manager
//! using penrose, ranging from bare bones minimal to custom extensions and hooks.
//!
//! > **NOTE**: in order to use the xcb implementation of penrose, you will need to install the C
//! > libraries that are dependencies (namely xcb, Cairo and Pango).
//!
//!
//! ## Digging into the API
//!
//! The suggested reading order for getting to grips with the penrose API is to first look at the
//! [pure][7] data structures that represent the logical state of your window manager before digging
//! in to the [core][8] module which contains the majority of the functionality you are likely to
//! want to work with. If you are interested in the lower level X11 interactions (or need to make
//! requests to the X server directly) you should check out the [x][9] module and its associated
//! traits. To add functionality and flexability to your window manager, there are the [builtin][10]
//! and [extensions][11] modules which offer capabilities built on top of the rest of penrose.
