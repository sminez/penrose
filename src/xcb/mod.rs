//! Helpers and utilities for using XCB as a back end for penrose
//!
//! This is the reference implementation of the core Penrose traits that are required to back the
//! [WindowManager][1] when talking to the X server. The code in this module is build on top of the
//! [xcb][2], [pango][3] and [cairo][4] C libraries and strives to be as simple as possible (as
//! opposed to optimising for performance).
//!
//! # Available features
//! - `xcb_draw`: adds `pango` and `cairo` as build dependencies and provides implementations of
//!   the [Draw][6] and [DrawContext][7] traits.
//! - `keysyms`: enable [KeyPressDraw][8] functionality for [XcbDraw][9]
//!
//! # C level documentation
//!
//! Docs for the underlying `xcb` C library can be found [here][10].
