/**
 * Convert user friendly key bindings into X keycodes.
 *
 * Allows the user to define their keybindings using the gen_keybindings macro
 * which calls through to this. Bindings are of the form '<MOD>-<key name>'
 * with multipple modifiers being allowed, and keynames being taken from the
 * output of 'xmodmap -pke'.
 *
 * Allowed modifiers are:
 *   M - Super
 *   A - Alt
 *   C - Ctrl
 *   S - Shift
 *
 * The user friendly patterns are parsed into a modifier mask and X key code
 * pair that is then grabbed by penrose to trigger the bound action.
