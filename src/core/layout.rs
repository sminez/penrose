 * Layouts are expected to have a 'main area' that holds the clients with primary focus and any
 * number of secondary areas for the remaining clients to be tiled.
 * The user can increase/decrease the size of the main area by setting 'ratio' via key bindings
 * which should determine the relative size of the main area compared to other cliens.  Layouts
 * maintain their own state for number of clients in the main area and ratio which will be passed
 * through to the layout function when it is called.
