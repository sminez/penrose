// TODO: Do I also need versions of the layout methods that have access to the overall X state as well?
//       That would allow for doing more involved layouts that were aware of things like the specific
//       program running in each client window or the properties on each client.
//       The layouts I'm writing initially are all fairly simple from that perspective so there is no
//       need for it to start, and adding it later is possible using the same default imple deferral
//       approach used in `layout_workspace` if it _is_ needed in future without it needing to be a
//       breaking API change to the trait.

/// A [Layout] is responsible for positioning a [Stack] of clients in a given coordinate space denoting
/// the dimensions of users display.
///

/// the existing layout (e.g. increase the number of clients positioned in a "main" area) or replace
/// the existing Layout with a new one. There is no requirement to be able to handle all message types.
