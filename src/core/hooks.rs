//! Hook for adding additional functionality around standard WindowManager actions
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! Hooks are the primary way of injecting custom functionality into penrose when you want to go
//! beyond simply binding actions to key presses. There are multiple points in normal
//! [WindowManager] execution that will trigger the running of user defined hooks, during which you
//! will have complete control over the window manager state and (importantly) block the event loop
//! until your hook exits. For details of what hook points are available, see each of the trait
//! methods outlined below. Note that a single [Hook] can register itself to be called at multiple
//! hook points (all, if desired!) and that hooks are allways called in the order that they are
//! registered with the [WindowManager] on init (i.e. the order of the `Vec` itself).
//!
//! # Implementing Hook
//!
//! As an example of how to write a hook and register it, lets implement a simple hook that logs
//! each new client that is added to a particular workspace, noting if we've seen it before or not.
//! Completely pointless, but it will serve as a nice starting point to show what is happening.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use penrose::{
//!     core::{
//!         hooks::Hook,
//!         xconnection::{XConn, Xid},
//!     },
//!     xcb::XcbConnection,
//!     Config, Result, WindowManager, logging_error_handler
//! };
//!
//! use std::collections::{HashMap, HashSet};
//!
//! // Start with the struct itself which will contain any internal state we need to track
//! pub struct LogAddedClients {
//!     seen: HashMap<usize, HashSet<Xid>>,
//! }
//!
//! // It is idiomatic for Hooks to provide a `new` method that returns a pre-boxed struct
//! // so that you can add it straight into your hooks Vector in your main.rs
//! impl LogAddedClients {
//!     pub fn new() -> Box<Self> {
//!         Box::new(Self { seen: HashMap::new() })
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! // As we only care about one of the hook points, that is the only method we need to
//! // implement: all other Hook methods for this struct will be no-ops
//! impl<X: XConn> Hook<X> for LogAddedClients {
//!     fn client_added_to_workspace(
//!         &mut self,
//!         wm: &mut WindowManager<X>,
//!         id: Xid,
//!         wix: usize
//!     ) -> Result<()> {
//!         let clients = self.seen.entry(wix).or_insert(HashSet::new());
//!         let msg = if clients.contains(&id) {
//!             format!("'{}' has been on '{}' before!", id, wix)
//!         } else {
//!             clients.insert(id);
//!             format!("'{}' was added to '{}' for the first time", id, wix)
//!         };
//!
//!         wm.log(&msg)
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! // Now we simply pass our hook to the WindowManager when we create it
//! fn main() -> penrose::Result<()> {
//!     let mut manager = WindowManager::new(
//!         Config::default(),
//!         XcbConnection::new()?,
//!         vec![LogAddedClients::new()],
//!         logging_error_handler()
//!     );
//!
//!     manager.init()?;
//!
//!     // rest of your startup logic here
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Now, whenever a [Client] is added to a [Workspace][1] (either because it has been newly created,
//! or because it has been moved from one workspace to another) our hook will be called, and our
//! log message will be included in the penrose log stream. More complicated hooks can be built
//! that listen to multiple triggers, but most of the time you will likely only need to implement a
//! single method. For an example of a more complex set up, see the [Scratchpad][2] extension which
//! uses multiple hooks to spawn and manage a client program outside of normal `WindowManager`
//! operation.
//!
//! # When hooks are called
//!
//! Each Hook trigger will be called as part of normal execution of `WindowManager` methods at a
//! point that should be relatively intuitive based on the name of the method. Each method provides
//! a more detailed explanation of exactly what conditions it will be called under. If you would
//! like to see exactly which user level actions lead to specific triggers, try turning on `DEBUG`
//! logging in your logging config as part of your **main.rs** and lookk for the "Running <method>
//! hooks" message that each trigger logs out.
//!
//! *Please see the documentation on each of the individual methods for more details.*
//!
//! # WindowManager execution with user defined Hooks
//!
//! As mentioned above, each time a hook trigger point is reached the `WindowManager` stops normal
//! execution (including responding to [XEvents][3]) and each of the registered hooks is called in
//! turn. If the hook implements the method associated with the trigger that has been hit, then
//! your logic will be run and you will have a mutable reference to the current [WindowManager]
//! state, giving you complete control over what happens next. Note that method calls on the
//! `WindowManager` itself will (of course) resolve immediately, but that any actions which
//! generate [XEvents][3] will only be processed once all hooks have run and control has returned to
//! the manager itself.
