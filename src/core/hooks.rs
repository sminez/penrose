 * default implementation that must be overriden to provide functionality. Hooks may 'subscribe' to
 * multiple triggers to implement more complex behaviours and may store additional state. Care
 * should be taken when writing [Hook] impls to ensure that infinite loops are not created by nested
 * triggers and that, where possible, support for other hooks running from the same triggers is
