/**
 * A layout that aims to mimic the feel of having multiple pieces of paper fanned out on a desk,
 * inspired by <http://10gui.com/>
 *
 * Without access to the custom hardware required for 10gui, we instead have to rely on the WM
 * actions we have available: n_main is ignored and instead, the focused client takes up ratio% of
 * the screen, with the remaining windows being stacked on top of one another to either side. Think
 * fanning out a hand of cards and then pulling one out and placing it on top of the fan.
