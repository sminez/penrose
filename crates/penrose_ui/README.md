# Penrose UI

_GUI elements for the penrose window manager library_

The functionality provided by this crate is a _very_ thin wrapper over xlib and fontconfig
to support minimal text based UIs such as a status bar or simple menu. It may be possible
to use this to write a stand alone UI outside of direct integration with the Penrose window
manager crate but that is not the supported use case this crate has been written for.

## Bar
A lightweight and minimal status bar.
